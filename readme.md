# MyLeagueApp a React App
## Purpose:
In League of Legends, your item build determines just about everything about your character. You start off with base stats depending on your champion(ranged,melee,caster) and so much more but you only gain a small amount of stats per when leveling up. The bulk of your power will come from builds and what you choose to buy with that hard earned gold. This means your mid/late game stats determine how effective you are against your opponents and numbers can matter in how effective your champion is. There are plenty of sites out there which show the most common items,  items that pros build and much more but there aren't many that give you your actual stats after buying these items. Having a hard coded number of attack damage and ability power to calculate your exact damage will be a huge deal players venturing onto the rift. Against 5 tanks? what build will give me the most armor pen and attack damage since I'll be relatively safe with a lot of damage. 5 assassins this time? what's going to offer a decent amount of damage and protection so i can actually stay alive to do damage. This app will allow you to see that before purchasing your items. 
## Audience: 
This app benefits the casual player practicing builds rather than following a recommended list all the way up to pro players who know what numbers they need to kill a champion. Instead of having to do quick math let this app provide you with a source of truth regarding those stats.
